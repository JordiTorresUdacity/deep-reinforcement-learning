# Udacity deep-reinforcement-learning Navigation project
Navigation problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent

# Project Details

## Unity ML-Agents
**Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents)** is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. For game developers, these trained agents can be used for multiple purposes, including controlling [NPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character) behavior (in a variety of settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds and evaluating different game design decisions pre-release. In this project I use Unity's rich environments to design, train, and evaluate a deep reinforcement learning algorithms.  You can learn more about ML-Agents by perusing the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

### Instructions
